# Physical-Control-of-Qubits

This repo contains the following files:
 
- My guide on the physical control of qubits (pdf). This document contains a complete derivation and an in-depth discussion of single qubit Rabi oscilaltions on and off resonance.

- Interactive jupyter notebook project examining CORPSE pulse sequence to reduce off-resonant errors (ipynb), and the corresponding pdf outful file (pdf).

All works are still in progress and will be regularly updated.
