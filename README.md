# Physical-Control-of-Qubits

This repo contains the following files:
 
1. My guide on the physical control of qubits (pdf). This document contains a complete derivation of single qubit dynamics, single qubit Rabi oscillations on and off resonance, population transfer, and fidelity.

2. Interactive jupyter notebook project examining the CORPSE composite pulse sequence to reduce systematic off-resonant errors (ipynb). There are interactive widgets embedded within the notebook that allow the user to play around with different values for the off-resonant error.

3. The corresponding pdf outful file (pdf) to document 2. For cells with interactive widgets, the output uses the widgets' default value for the off-resonant error (chosen to be 0.1 across all widgets).

All works are still in progress and will be regularly updated.
